# Queue Stack Sort  
  
One of our assignments during college was to write our own sort, this was my attempt as creating a sort that didn't mimic any of 
the sorts we had learned during college, given an input of integers what this sort does is bounces values between an array of 
queues and an array of stacks, until each stack contains only instances of the same number and the number of queues are reduced 
to 1, after that the sort finishes and the output is displayed.

Currently the code allows you to see this processes and the intermediatary states of the stacks and queues to better understand 
the sort's functions, it can be difficult to fully explain in a succinct manner.
