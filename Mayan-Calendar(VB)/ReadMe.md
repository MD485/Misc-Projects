# Mayan Calender
A project I did during college in my spare time experimenting with forms.
It converts an input written in a Julian Calendar format to a Mayan Calendar format.

While the inital code had some poor practices like a 13x nested if statement and a variable named something irrelevent 
to it's purpose, even now looking at the code I noticed I had spent a decent amount of time figuring out the logistics 
of such a program and facilitating the functionality I want, a project I might not be able to do 10x as quickly today.

One of my first Visual Basic projects, written in 2016.
