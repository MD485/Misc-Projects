# Misc-Projects
A repository mainly meant to hold projects too small or too lacking in uniqueness to require their own repository.  
Projects here are either a project does something cool or has an interesting technique in it's design/implementation.  
Projects are grouped by name, then by the language they were written in. e.g. My-Project(VB), Quadcopter-Controls(C), etc.
